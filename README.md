**README**

This folder contains a collection of machine learning and data science projects in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format. The projects cover various topics and include relevant Python files and datasets for learning purposes.

### Topics Covered:

1. **File Operations (FileOperations.ipynb):**
   This notebook covers basic file operations in Python, such as reading from and writing to files.

2. **Linear Regression (Linear_Regression.ipynb):**
   This notebook explores linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

3. **Mean and Standard Deviation (Mean_Standard Deviation.ipynb):**
   This notebook discusses the concepts of mean and standard deviation, essential statistical measures for understanding the distribution of data.

4. **Normal Probability Distribution (Normal_Probability_Distribution.ipynb):**
   This notebook introduces the normal probability distribution, a common continuous probability distribution that often arises in natural phenomena.

5. **NumPy Operations (Numpy_operations.ipynb):**
   This notebook covers various operations and functionalities provided by NumPy, a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python.

6. **Open Government Data Analysis (Open Government Data Analysis.ipynb):**
   This notebook focuses on analyzing open government data, demonstrating techniques for data exploration and visualization using Python.

7. **Polynomial Linear Regression (Polynomial_Linear_Regression.ipynb):**
   This notebook extends the concept of linear regression to polynomial regression, where the relationship between variables is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial.

8. **Random Forest (Random_forest.ipynb):**
   This notebook introduces random forests, an ensemble learning method for classification and regression tasks, utilizing multiple decision trees.

9. **Support Vector Machine (SVM.ipynb):**
   This notebook explores support vector machines (SVM), a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

10. **Movie Recommendation System:**
    This project focuses on building a movie recommendation system, likely utilizing techniques such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.

### Datasets:

- **2010_ACCIDENTS_GU_BCN_2010.csv**
- **2013_ACCIDENTS_GU_BCN_2013.csv**
  These datasets contain accident data from Barcelona, likely used for analysis and modeling in relevant notebooks.
